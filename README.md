# Puzzle-Game
Simple puzzle game from an AP CS final project. You are the square; win a puzzle in the map and return to the starting room to complete it. There are five puzzles in total.
The maze is a little tricky, but good luck anyways!

PS: Why would you ever play this game? Please don't, there are better things to do with your time.
